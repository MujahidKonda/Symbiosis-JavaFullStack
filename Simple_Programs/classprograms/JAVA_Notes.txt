JAVA Static keyword

	DEFINATION:-
		~ this feature is useful when we want to create a variable common to all instances of a class.
		~ this static can be : 	1. variable(also know as class variable)
								2. method(also know as class method)
								3. block
								4. nested class
		~ if you declare any variable as static, it is know as static variable.
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ it makes your program memory efficient.

JAVA Constructor 

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object
		~ Java Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation.
		~ It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is know as constructors.
	BASIC RULES:-
		~ Constructor name must be same as its class name.
		~ Constructor must have no explicit return type
	TYPES:-
		~ Default Constructor (no argument constructor)

JAVA Polymorphism

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Polymorphism is an important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
		~ Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
		~ The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
		~ Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
	TYPES:-
		~ Compile time polymorphism(Static Polymorphism)
		~ Runtime Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism)
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Code reusability, extensibility
		~ Overloaded Constructor
		~ Ease of Implementation
		~ Code Cleanliness
		~ Aligned with real world
