JAVA Static keyword

	DEFINATION:-
		~ this feature is useful when we want to create a variable common to all instances of a class.
		~ this static can be : 	1. variable(also know as class variable)
								2. method(also know as class method)
								3. block
								4. nested class
		~ if you declare any variable as static, it is know as static variable.
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ it makes your program memory efficient.

JAVA Constructor 

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object
		~ Java Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation.
		~ It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is know as constructors.
	BASIC RULES:-
		~ Constructor name must be same as its class name.
		~ Constructor must have no explicit return type
	TYPES:-
		~ Default Constructor (no argument constructor)
		~ Parameterized Constructor.

JAVA Polymorphism

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Polymorphism is an important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
		~ Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
		~ The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
		~ Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
	TYPES:-
		~ Compile time polymorphism(Static Polymorphism)
		~ Runtime Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism)
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Code reusability, extensibility
		~ Overloaded Constructor
		~ Ease of Implementation
		~ Code Cleanliness
		~ Aligned with real world

JAVA Encapsulation

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together into a single unit.
		~ This unit is known as an object.
		~ Encapsulation is used to hide the implementation details of an object from other objects.
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Data hiding
		~ Code reusability
		~ Improved maintainability
		~ Increased security

JAVA Abstraction

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user.
		~ The user only sees the essential details of the object.
		~ Abstraction is used to make the code easier to understand and use.
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Code reusability
		~ Improved maintainability
		~ Increased security

JAVA Inheritance

	DEFINATION:-
		~ Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.
		~ The new class is called the child class and the existing class is called the parent class.
		~ Inheritance allows the child class to inherit the properties and methods of the parent class.
	TYPES:-
		~ Single level inheritance
		~ Multilevel inheritance
		~ Hierarchical inheritance
		~ Multiple inheritance
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Code reusability
		~ Improved maintainability
		~ Increased security

JAVA Interface

	DEFINATION:-
		~ An interface is a contract between two or more classes.
		~ It defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
		~ An interface cannot contain any instance variables.
	TYPES:-
		~ Single interface
		~ Multiple interface
	ADVANTAGES:-
		~ Code reusability
		~ Improved maintainability
		~ Increased security

JAVA Abstract Class

	DEFINATION:-
		~ An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
		~ It can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
		~ An abstract method is a method that does not have a body.
		~ A class that extends an abstract class must implement all of the abstract methods of the parent class.
	TYPES:-
		~ Simple abstract class
		~ Abstract class with abstract methods
		~
